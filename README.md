# neural-network-projects

This is my collection of Neural Networks mini-projects as I'm learning NN, DNN, CNN and RNN. 

I have learnt a lot about Neural Networks from [Jason's](http://machinelearningmastery.com/) blog. These mini-projects are available on Jason's website. After experimenting with each tutorial I have them here for quick future reference.

Recommended order for exploring these projects is as follows:

### Deep Neural Networks

- Life-Cycle for Neural Network Models in Keras
- My first Neural Network with Keras
- Multi-Class classification with Keras
- Check-Point Deep Learning Models in Keras
- Display Deep Learning Model Training History in Keras
- Dropout Regularization in Deep Learning Models with Keras
- Save and Load Keras Deep Learning Models
- Using Learning Rate Schedules for Deep Learning Models with Keras

### Convolutional Neural Networks

- Handwritten Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks
- Object Recognition in CIFAR-10 with Convolutional Neural Networks
- Predict Sentiment From Movie Reviews
- Text Classification with Keras and GloVe Embedding

### Recurrent Neural Networks

- Time Series Prediction with LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks with Keras
- Sequence Classification with LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks with Keras
- Understanding Stateful LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks with Keras
- Text Generation With LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks with Keras
